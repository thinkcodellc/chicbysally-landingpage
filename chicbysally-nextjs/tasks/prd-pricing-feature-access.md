# Product Requirements Document: Pricing Page and Feature-Based Access Control

**PRD Reference:** `tasks/prd-pricing-feature-access.md`

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This feature implements a comprehensive pricing page using Clerk's prebuilt PricingTable component and establishes feature-based access control for the StyleCard functionality. The system will restrict access to the StyleCard page based on subscription features, ensuring only users with the "StyleCard" feature can access the virtual try-on functionality.

## 2. Goals

- Create a professional pricing page that displays subscription plans using Clerk's prebuilt PricingTable component
- Implement feature-based access control to restrict StyleCard page access
- Ensure seamless integration with existing authentication and UI patterns
- Maintain consistent styling and user experience with the current application
- Provide clear upgrade paths for users without the required feature

## 3. User Stories

- As a visitor, I want to see clear pricing options so I can choose a plan that fits my needs
- As a signed-in user, I want to see my current subscription status and available upgrade options
- As a user with the "StyleCard" feature, I want to access the virtual try-on functionality
- As a user without the "StyleCard" feature, I want to be redirected to the pricing page with clear upgrade options
- As a user, I want the pricing page and access control to match the existing site's theme and design

## 4. Functional Requirements

1. The system must display a pricing page at `/pricing` using Clerk's `<PricingTable />` component
2. The system must restrict access to `/stylecard` page based on the "StyleCard" feature entitlement
3. The system must redirect users without the "StyleCard" feature to the pricing page when they attempt to access `/stylecard`
4. The system must display a fallback message for users without the required feature
5. The pricing page must follow the existing application's color scheme and styling patterns
6. The feature check must work both server-side and client-side
7. The system must integrate with existing Clerk authentication setup
8. The pricing page must be responsive and accessible

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Creating custom pricing plans (using Clerk's existing plans)
- Implementing complex permission hierarchies beyond feature-based access
- Building custom checkout flows (using Clerk's prebuilt components)
- Modifying existing authentication flows
- Creating analytics for pricing page performance

## 6. Design Considerations

- Use existing color palette: pink/purple gradients, rose backgrounds, consistent with current Navbar and styling
- Maintain responsive design patterns used throughout the application
- Follow existing component structure and naming conventions
- Use Clerk's prebuilt components for consistency and reduced maintenance
- Ensure proper loading states and error handling

## 7. Technical Considerations

- Integration with existing ClerkProvider setup in `src/app/layout.tsx`
- Use of Clerk's `auth().has()` method for server-side feature checking
- Use of Clerk's `<Protect />` component for client-side feature checking
- Proper TypeScript typing for all components
- Integration with existing Navbar and layout components
- Environment variable configuration for Clerk features

## 8. Success Metrics

- Users can successfully view pricing options and subscribe to plans
- Users with "StyleCard" feature can access the StyleCard page
- Users without "StyleCard" feature are properly redirected to pricing page
- No authentication or authorization errors in production
- Consistent styling and user experience with existing pages
- Successful build and deployment to Vercel

## 9. Open Questions

- What specific feature name should be used in Clerk for the StyleCard access?
- Should the redirect be immediate or show a landing page first?
- How should the pricing table be customized for the specific use case?
- What happens when a user's subscription expires?
