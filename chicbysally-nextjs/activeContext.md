# Active Context for Pricing Page and Feature-Based Access Control Implementation

## Current Working Documents
- **PRD:** `tasks/prd-pricing-feature-access.md`
- **Task List:** `tasks/tasks-pricing-feature-access.md`

## Current Active Sub-task
- **Task ID:** 3.1
- **Description:** Test pricing page with different user states (authenticated/unauthenticated)

## Recent Critical Decisions
- Using Clerk's prebuilt PricingTable component for consistency and reduced maintenance
- Implementing feature-based access control using Clerk's `<Protect />` component and `auth().has()` method
- Following existing application styling patterns (pink/purple gradients, rose backgrounds)

## Key Learnings
- Clerk v6 requires explicit `dynamic` prop on ClerkProvider for proper static generation
- Application uses Tailwind CSS with custom color configuration
- Existing pages follow a consistent layout pattern with Navbar integration
- Authentication is handled through ClerkProvider in root layout

## Immediate Blockers/Questions
- Need to confirm the exact feature name to use in Clerk for "StyleCard" access
- Need to determine if redirect should be immediate or show a landing page first
